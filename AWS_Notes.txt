------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services under Compute Domain

1) EC2 - Elastic Cloud Computing Service -> Resizable compute capacity machine.

2) Lamda- It is like Ec2 service; You can assume it to be an advanced version of ec2; You cannot use lamda for hosting the applications 
like EC2; It can be only used to perform some background execution like compressing the images in the application based on certain events.

3) Elastic Beanstalk - This is also the advanced version of EC2 which is used for hosting the application. This service deploys your 
application without worrying about the hardware.

4) Elastic Load Balancer- This service is used to distribute your workload among the multiple EC2 instances. The traffic coming to the 
instances is equally distributed among all the instances.  

5) Autoscaling- It is used for automatic upscaling and downscaling. If you have a website with 5 EC2 instances, you can configure that 
if your load is 70 percent, then scale it to 6th instance server. You can also set the metrics for CPU utilisation of the EC2 if the 
traffic is less then reduce the CPU capacity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Services under Storage Domain

1) S3- Simple Storage System; which is object based file system. You have to create a bucket. 

2) Cloud Front- It is CDN(Content delivery network). It is a caging service. If user connects to a website which is very far away from 
their location then that website can be caged to the location which is near to their location because of which response time and latency is 
reduced.

 // Edge Location- It is a caged webserver near your place where your website is caged.

3) Elastic Block Storage(EBS)- It is like a hard drive, whenever we use EC2, somewhere our OS is stored or softwares are also stored. 
Every EC2 is backed up by default EBS volume. One EBS can be connected to one EC2 but vice versa is not applicable.

4) Amazon Glacier- It is data archive service. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snowball Service

It is a data transfer service, in AWS infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storage Gateway Service- 
It is used between you datacenters and the cloud. Suppose you have a database server and an application server. Storage gateway sits in
between the webserver and the data base server which keeps on taking the snapshots of database and stores it in a S3 bucket.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database Domains

1) RDS- It is not the Database, but it manages the Relational data. 

2) Aurora- It is the database created by amazon. It is based on MySQL only.

3) DynamoDB- This will manage Non-relational database.

4) Elastic Cache- 

5) Red Shift- It is data analytical service.

Jul11thHariCustomVPC  - Custom VPC Name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Domian Services- 

1) VPC-  It is a virtual network. All resources launched in the same VPC can interact with each other.

2) Direct Connect-  This is a replacement of a dedicated Internet connection. It's a leased line in the AWS infrastructure. 

3) Route 53- This is a Domain name Service in the AWS infrastructure. Whenever a url is entered then that url is directed to DNS and 
which is converted into IP Addresses. Name servers in the DNS are are provided by Route 53 service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subnets-  Subnet is a portion of network which shares a common address component. You can also define a subnet as all the devices whose 
IP Addresses have the same prefix. 

Ex- Suppose there are 5 machines with IP addresses 100.100.100.1, 100.100.100.2 etc. All these have the same prefix and thus form the 
subnets.


Security Groups- It is like a virtual firewall for your instance to control your inbound and outbound traffic. This always acts at instance
level, you cannot configure a group in the subnet level. 

Route Table- Contains a set of rules and those rules are called as Route. That route will specify where the network traffic should be 
directed. Each subnet in the VPC must be associated with a route table.

ACL- Access Control List

NAT- A device which forwards traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the internet or other AWS services and sends response 
back to the instance. NAT gateway allows all the outbound traffic which is getting originated from your private instance to go to the 
internet and get reply and also to get response from private subnet.

Internet Gateway- It is VPC component that allows communication between the instances in on pc and internet. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Services under Management Domain- 

1) Cloud Watch-  This service will watch all resources in AWS infrastructure.
Ex. You can create an alarm using Cloud Watch which can trigger if CPU usage crosses 70 percent.

2) Cloud Formation- This is a template service.

3) Cloud Trail- This is an auditing or logging service where cloud trail can generate a log if any error occurs and store that log in S3 
bucket.

4) CLI- (Command Line Interface) This is a replacement of GUI. 

5) Ops Work- This is a configuration Management service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security Domain- 

1) IAM- (Indentification Authentication Management) This service provides granula access to the user.

2) KMS- (Key Management Service) This is used to create a public and private key.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) SMS- (Simple Mail Service) This can be used to send bulk mail. 

2) SQS- (Simple Queue Server) 

3) SNS- (Simple Notification Service) 


IOPS- Inout and output Operation per second

PIOP- Block level Storage

EBS- It is distributed, replicated block storage that is optimized for consistency and low latency read and write operations.

EBS Volume- You can attach a volume to the instance.

EBS Snapshot- Snapshot can be used to create multiple column.


AWS provides 3 types of storage- 

1) General Purpose(SSD) 

2) PIOP-Provisional Input and Output (SSD)

3) Magnetic Storage

Elastic Load Balancing- 

Automatically distributes the incoming application traffic accross multiple targets like EC2 instances or containers or Ip addresses.
It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single availability zone or accross serveral availability zones.
There are 3 types of Load Balancers- 

1) Application Load Balancer (Works at Application Layer) Best Suitable for load balancing HHTP and HTTPS
2) Network Load Balance (Works at Network or TCP/IP layer) Best suitable for load balancing of TCP and Transport layer security traffic. 
3) Classic Load balancer (deprecated)


Autoscaling is a feature that automatically adds or removes compute resources depending upon actual usage. This is also sometimes 
reffered to as 'Automatic Elasticity'. It ensures that additional capacity is seemlessly increased during high demand and decreased when 
the demand drops which enables consistence performace with low cost.


DNS Name- HariSaoCustomLoadBal-2645474.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com


Amazon ElastiCache - Amazon ElastiCache is a Caching-as-a-Service from Amazon Web Services. AWS simplifies setting up, managing, and scaling a 
distributed in-memory cache environment in the cloud. It provides a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution. 
AWS removes the complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment.
