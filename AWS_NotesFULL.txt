Amazon Web Services.......

------------EC2 Service--------------

1) Launch a virtual machine (search for EC2)

a linux virtual machine will load.

-------------Steps in virtual machine--------------

1) create a folder named CloudDemo on your machine
2) create a dynamic web project in eclipse or sts (whichever has TomCat v8)
3) 

in virtual machine install java using sudo yum install - java 1.8.0


Elastic ip is used to fix the ip address


------------S3 Service--------------
apache tomcat is not being downloaded, so we will keep the tar file in S3 bucket and then use it.

1) Search S3 
   Bucket Name: (should not have capital letters) 11thjulharis3bucket
	location virginia
2) next
	default all
3) next
	 uncheck block all options
4) create bucket.

5) open bucket select upload -> select war file-> ok
	select testaws.war action -> make public 
	add tar file (tomcat) -> upload -> select -> make public
6) select war file and copy the url 
7) go to virtual machine and cd to folder paste the url -> wget url
8) select tomcat and copy the url by clicking the name.
9) go to virtual machine and cd to folder and paste the url
10) extract using tar xf filename (here tomcat). 
11) cd to webapps of ectracted tomcat and wget the TestAWS.war file from the S3 bucket using the url.
12) chech the server.xml for port number.
13) cd to bin folder of extracted tomcat.
14) ./startup.sh tostart tomcat.
13) copy the ipv4 public ip and paste the ip followed by :port/TestAWS

--------------------------------------------------------DAY 2---------------------------------------------------

Different Domain in which AWS is offering the services

	1) Compute
	2) Storage Domain
	3) Migration
	4) Security-identity
	5) Network and content delivery domain
	6) Messaging
	7)Database Domain
	8) Management

Services in compute domain---------------------------

	1)EC2 -> Resizable compute capacity machine

	2)Lambda -> It is like EC2 Service (can be seen as advanced version of EC2). This cannot be used for hosting the application like EC2, it can only be used 
			to perform some background execution like compressing the images in the application, based on certain events.

	3)Elastic Bean Stalk ->This is also the advanced version of EC2 which is used for hosting the application. This service deploy your application without worring for
				underlying hardware

	4) Elastic Load Balancer -> Is used to distribute your workload among the multiple EC2 instances. The traffic coming to the instances is equally distributed among all 
			instances.
	
	5) Autoscaling  -> It is used for automatic upscaling and down scaling. 
		ex:- If you jave a website with 5 EC2 instances, if the load is 70% then scale it to 6th instance server. Matrices can be set for CPU utilization of the EC2
			if traffic is less then reduce the CPU capacity.

Storage Domain-------------------------------

	1) S3 (Simple Storage System) -> It is object based file system. Will have to create a bucket for it.
	
	2) Cloud Front  -> It is a CDN (Content Delivery Network). It is a caging service, if user connects to a website which is very far from their location then that website
				can be caged to the location which is near to their location because response time and latency is reduced.

	Note*--
		Edge Location -> is a caged web server near your place where your website is caged.

	3) EBS (Elastic Block Storage) -> It is like a hard drive. When we use EC2, somewhere OS is stored or software are also stored. Every EC2 is backuped by default 
					EBS volume. One EBS can be connected to single machine but vice versa is not applicable.

	4) Amazon Glacier ->  It is data archive service. When you have to store data that is not used frequently


SnowBall Service--------------------------

	It is a data transfer serivce in AWS infrastructure.

Storage GateWay Service  -> It is a service which is used b/w your datacenter and the cloud. 
		ex: Suppose you have databse server and application server Strorage gateway sits b/w the web server and 
			data base server keeps on taking the snapshots of database and store it in a S3 bucket.


Database Domain-------------------------

	1)RDS -> it is not the DB, but it manages the Relation data.
	
	2) Aurora -> It is a database created by amazon. It is based on MySql only.

	3) DynamoDB -> This will manage Non_Relation database.
	
	4) Elastic Cache -> 
	
	5) Red Shift -> It is data analytics service.

Network Domain Service-------------------

	1) VPC -> It is virtual network, all the resources launched in same VPC can interact with ecah other.
	
	2) Direct Connet -> This is replacement of the dedicated internet connection. Its a lease line in the AWS infrastructure

	3) Root 53 -> This is DNS (Domain Name Service) in the AWS infrastructure.
			From URL -> Route 53 -> Computer Network
		Whenever url is entered, that url are directed to the DNS and which is converted into IP address
		So name server in the DNS are provided by the Route 53 Service

Subnet ---------------------------------

subnet -> is a portion of network which shares a common address component. You can also define subnet as all devices whose IP address have same prefix.
		Ex:  100.100.100.1
		     100.100.100.2 both machine are belonging to same subnet

Security group------------------------

	It is like a virtual firewall for your online instance control inbound and outbound traffic. Acts at instance level.

Route Table-------------------------
	contains set of rules called Routes. The Route specifies where network traffci should be directed. Route should be associated with subnet	
	Each subnet in the VPC must be associated with route  table

ACL (Access Control List)----------------------
NAT -----------
	A device forward traffic from the instance in the private subnet to the internet or other services and sends response back to the instance.

Internet Gateway  -> It is VPC component that allow communication b/w instance in your VPC and internet.
	 


---------------Database Serivces Steps---------------------------------------------			

1) Create a database
2) Select MySql
3) Templates should be free tire.
4) select switch to default flow creation (floating dialog box on the screen) if the page in not loaded in proper format.
5) also chech only free tire option.
6) click next
7) Specify the DB Details

-----------------Steps to create volume-----------------------

1) go to volumes
2) Create volume
3) check volume in terminal using lsblk command.
4) go to action and select attach volume
5) check the volume again using command lsdlk.
6) in terminal -> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf   (for formatting)
		sudo mkdir /vol2
		sudo mount /dev/xvdf /vol2
		vim welcome.txt
		press i to insert
			type something
		press esc
		type :wq and press enter
		cat welcome.txt to see the file text
		cd home
		cd ec2-user
		sudo cp welcome.txt /vol2

for automounting 
	sudo vi /ect/fstab

	press i
	goto next line and type dev/xvdf /vol2 ext4 defaults 0 0
	cat /etc/fstab

--------------------Steps to create a snapshot--------------------------
Select resource type : volume

Volume : vol-0c

Desscription : some desc

Encrypted: not encrypted

Key : 11thjulharikey

value : 11thjulhariValue

open snapshot

in action -> create volume
	volume type : general purpose ssd
	ap-south-1a
	key and pair value
create a new instance in correct availability zone here 1a

in putty

	sudo mkdir /vol3
	sudo mount /dev/xvdg /vol3
	cd /vol3
	cat welcome.txt  (should be already present)



Elastic LOad Balancing -----------------------------

	Automaticallly distrubute incoming application traffice accross multiple target like EC2 instances or containers or IP addresses. 
	It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in single avalilability zone or multiple availability zone.

	# type of load balancer
	1)Application load balancer -> operates at layer no 7 of the OSI model, best suitable for load balancing of HTTp and HTTPS
	2)Network load balancer		-> operates at connection level of layer no 4 in OSI model.best suitable for load balancing of TCp protocol and Transport layer security traffic
	3)classic load balance (depricated) can only be used with EC2 instance


AutoScaling -> cloud feature that automatically adds or removes compute resources depending upon actual usage. 
	SOme time also reffered as Automatic elasticity. It ensures that additional capacity seamlessely increase during high demand and decrease when 
		demand drops which enables consistent performance


--------------------Steps for load balancing-----------------
Select your instance
action -> image -> create image
	image name -> Jul11hari
	other default option
